light_ws2812 V2.4
============

Light weight library to control WS2812 based LEDS and LED Strings on 8-Bit AVR and ARM microcontrollers. The new version 2 of this library supports a simplified interface and arbitrary CPU clock. V2.1 finally adds Arduino support.

[See the library in action on a LPC810](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uwxt7SuSV7Y)

**New** 
- [companion library for APA102 and SK9822 LEDs](https://github.com/cpldcpu/light_ws2812/tree/master/light_apa102_AVR)
- Added support for SK6812RGBW LED strings. See examples.
 
**Supported Devices**
- WS2811 800kHz mode, WS2812S, WS2812B, WS2812C
- WS2813: Connect BIN of the first LED to ground. 
- SK6812, SK6812RGBW
- PD9853
- APA106, APA104
- Other WS2812 clones: Untested
- APA102, APA102C, SK9822: Use dedicated library
 
Description
===========

This is a small Ansi-C library to control WS2811/WS2812 based RGB Leds and strings. Only the 800kHz
high-speed mode is supported. This library uses a bit-banging approach with cycle optimized assembler
innerloops. Some advantages of this approach compared to other solutions are:

- Compatible to all AVR MCUs since it does not rely on special periphery.
- The code timing is automatically adjusted to the CPU clock at compile time.
- A CPU clock speed of 8 MHz and up is recommended, but even 4 MHz may work under some circumstances.
- Much smaller program code: Size optimized assembler without unrolled loops (<50 bytes in most cases)
- Supports standard AVR, reduced core AVR (Attiny 4/5/9/10/20/40) and XMEGA (untested) without special case handling.
- Experimental Cortex-M0 ARM support.

The timing values used in the library were adjusted to work on all devices. Look [here](http://cpldcpu.wordpress.com/2014/01/14/light_ws2812-library-v2-0-part-i-understanding-the-ws2812/) and [here](http://cpldcpu.wordpress.com/2014/01/19/light_ws2812-library-v2-0/) for details.

Usage C - Interface
===================

- Add "light_ws2812.c", "light_ws2812.h" and "ws2812_config.h" to your project. 
- Update "ws2812_config.h" according to your I/O pin.
- Make sure F\_CPU is correctly defined in your makefile or the project. (For AtmelStudio: Project->Properties->Toolchain->AVR/GNU C Compiler->Symbols. Add symbol F_CPU=xxxxx)
- Call "ws2812\_setleds" with a pointer to the LED array and the number LEDs.
- Alternatively you can use "ws2812\_setleds\_pin" to control up to 8 LED strips on the same Port.

Examples are provided in the [Examples](https://github.com/cpldcpu/light_ws2812/tree/master/light_ws2812_AVR/Examples) folder. You can build them with the supplied makefile.


Usage Arduino
=============

- If you have Arduino 1.0.5 or newer, simply import the zipfile from light\_ws2812\_arduino with sketch->import library.
- Please refer to [these](http://arduino.cc/en/Guide/Libraries) instruction for older versions.
- To see how you can use it, have a look at the examples.
- Make sure the Pin you use to address the LEDs really exists! If not, the sketch won't compile or doesn't run correctly on your Arduino.
- In case of ATtiny85/45/25, library works with [ATtiny "Classic" Core](https://github.com/SpenceKonde/ATTinyCore). Tested with Arduino IDE 1.6.7 and ATtiny Classic 1.0.6 and 8MHz internal oscillator, B.O.D disabled. 

Usage C++ - Interface
=====================
- Add "light_ws2812.cpp", "WS2812.cpp" and "WS2812.h" from the Arduino folder to your project.
- Refer to the header WS2812.h to determine how to use the class.
- Ports and LED-Count are handled dynamically, so you can add as many LED-Strips as you got free outpupt ports! 


Troubleshooting 
================
Please note that incorrect timing is rarely the source of problems. If you want to save some time, go through the items below before altering the library.

#### None or only a part of the string is lighting up ####

 * Did you pass the correct array size in the function call?
 * Is the pin configuration correct?
 * Is anything else connected to the output pin you are using? Some development boards have LEDs connected to various pins.
 * Did you choose the correct CPU frequency setting? Did you initialize the clock correctly?

#### The LEDs are flickering and are not showing the intended color ####

 * This is often a problem with insufficient current sourcing capability.
 * Are you using a bypass capacitor for each LEDs as indicated in the datasheet? Not using a bypass capacitor will lead to erroneous behaviour. 
 * You may have to add an additional electrolytic capacitor at the input of your LED strip if you use long power supply lines.
 * Is your power supply able to supply the required current-level? If set to white at maximum brightness, each LED will draw 60mA. A single USB-Port is barely able to supply 10 LEDs.
 * The LEDs only display white: This can happen if the actual clock frequency of your MCU is lower than that given in F_CPU to the code.
