# Light Barrier
Light barrier should be an opaque material. I used 4mm birch plywood. The barrier consists of two halves.

barrier-bottom.dxf is for the piece that sits on top of the aluminium plate with the led strips on it.

barrier-top.dxf stacks on top of the bottom piece

The pieces are almost identical, except the bottom piece has some room for cable management.

# Light Diffuser
The diffuser should be made using a semi-transparent plastic. I used 2mm white polycarbonate. Make sure your plastic can be used with a lasercutter.
